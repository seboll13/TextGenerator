# TextGenerator
## A fun project to generate pretty intelligent text (at least we hope...)

The main text model is based on a Markov Chain representing each distinct word that is learned from the text file model along with all its possible transitions. The code is written in Python 3.10.

Note: to use the project, clone or fork the repo and add the file ```phrases.txt``` in a ```testing_sets``` folder. The larger the file, the better the model.
